## Fellowships

This folder contains some application materials for fellowships I have been successful at applying to. Currently, I have two research proposals uploaded. One is for the [Barry Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/), which is an undergraduate (Sophomore/Junior) scholarship for those intending to pursue a PhD in some STEM field. The other is for the Department of Energy's [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/), which is a 4-year fellowship for those intending to use supercomputing in their PhD.

I am happy to provide advice (and more materials) and review drafts on these programs, among others. Email me if you have any questions.
